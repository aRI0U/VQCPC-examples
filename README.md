# VQ-CPC examples

This repository contains a few musical examples generated from an alternative of [VQ-CPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10120) that I implemented during my research internship at [Sony CSL Paris](https://csl.sony.fr/). Networks have been trained on the [NES Music Database](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04278).

This repo contains 4 folders:

- `clusters/` that regroups subsequences from the dataset that are encoded by the same code
- `baseline/` that contains generations produced by a baseline Transformer without codes
- `VQCPC/` that contains variations generated by my model
- `linear_VQCPC` that contains variations generated by my model, with the relative attention function replaced by a [linear attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16236)

For each variation, the original sample and the variation are concatenated in the same audio file, with a pause of 1 second between the samples.
